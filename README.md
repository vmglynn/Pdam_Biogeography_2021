# Environmental and geographic factors structure cauliflower coral’s algal symbioses across the Indo-Pacific 

### About

This GitHub repository contains the code and some of the data needed to recreate the analyses of:

Glynn, V. M., Vollmer, S. V., Kline, D.I. & Barrett, R. D. H. Environmental and geographic factors structure cauliflower coral’s algal symbioses across the Indo-Pacific. _Journal of Biogeography_, in review. 

### Contents

This repository contains four folders: 
- **"ASV"** : R script to generate amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016), and the resulting RDS file
- **"Analyses"** : R scripts for alpha and beta diversity analyses, and to create pie charts for Symbiodiniaceae community composition across studied locations 
- **"PhylogeneticTree"** : FastTree2 (Price et al., 2010) phylogenetic tree, and associated R scripts to generate phylogenetic trees from the FastTree2 output 
- **"Taxonomy"** : Script for SymPortal taxonomic assignment using a local instance of the databse (Hume et al., 2019), parameters used for NCBI BLAST taxonomic assignment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and the resulting taxonomic assignments from Symportal and NCBI 

### Questions
If you have questions about the scripts and the associated data, please contact Victoria Marie Glynn (victoria.glynn@mail.mcgill.ca).
